## About Me

Hi there!

I'm a SAP Developer, Solution Architect, and DevOps specialist currently working as a freelancer in Warsaw, Poland. I have been developing applications within the SAP system for over 15 years, bringing deep expertise and innovative solutions to complex business challenges.

I'm passionate about clean code, scalable architecture, and bringing modern software engineering practices to the SAP ecosystem. Whether it's building a CI/CD pipeline from scratch, redesigning a legacy codebase, or mentoring development teams --- I bring the same commitment to quality and pragmatic problem-solving.
