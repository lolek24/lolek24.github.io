# My Approach

### Architecture First
Every solution starts with a solid, flexible architecture designed for maintainability and scale.

### Test-Driven Quality
Automated testing isn't optional --- it's the foundation of reliable SAP software.

### Continuous Improvement
Code review, refactoring, and rebuilding --- always pushing toward cleaner solutions.

### Pragmatic Problem-Solving
Balancing technical excellence with real-world constraints to deliver what matters.
